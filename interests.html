            <p>I’ve always been fascinated by how things work - especially computers and networks. I love building home servers for personal cloud storage, game hosting, and media streaming. Setting up file sharing, managing backups, and experimenting with virtualization is something I genuinely enjoy.</p>
            <p>My main computer is built for performance and multitasking. It runs on a Ryzen 7 9700X processor with 64GB of DDR5 RAM, dual 2TB Crucial P3 NVMe SSDs, and a 4070 Super GPU. I use a quad-monitor setup, which makes multitasking, monitoring systems, and working on creative projects incredibly efficient and enjoyable.</p>

          <div class="text">
            <p>I’m a huge aerospace nerd. What fascinates me most is the history and science behind flight and space exploration - from the Wright brothers to Saturn V rockets. I love learning how engineers overcame impossible challenges with limited technology, and how that shaped the world we live in. There's something inspiring about the constant push for innovation in aerospace.</p>

        <h2>Creative Projects</h2>
        <p>I enjoy building things from scratch, whether it’s a retro game emulator setup, a website, or a fictional universe. I like writing stories that blend tech, science fiction, and just a little humor. It’s a fun way to use my imagination and make people think - or laugh.</p>
        <p>Over the last few years, I’ve also developed an interest in lockpicking - not for anything shady, but because it’s a fun mental challenge. It’s like solving a physical puzzle where every click and tension adjustment matters. I enjoy practicing with different locks and techniques to sharpen my focus and patience.</p>

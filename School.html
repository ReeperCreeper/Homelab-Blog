        <p>I’m currently studying Information Technology through CSU Global. The program gives me flexibility while also pushing me to develop real-world skills in systems, networking, and security. It's a good fit for someone like me who learns best by doing and loves to experiment. CSU Global also allows me the flexibility to gain real workforce experience while still completing my education - which gives me a head start in applying what I learn directly to real-world situations.</p>

      <h2>Why I'm Studying IT</h2>
      <p>I’ve always enjoyed taking things apart and understanding how they work - especially tech. IT lets me turn that curiosity into a career. From configuring servers to understanding cybersecurity, everything I learn brings me one step closer to doing what I love full-time. I fell in love with IT the summer of my sophomore year, when I built my first Proxmox node. That project showed me how much I enjoyed building and managing systems. Setting up virtual machines, troubleshooting, and seeing it all work gave me a sense of pride and excitement that’s stuck with me ever since.</p>

      <h2>Ambitions Through School</h2>
      <p>My goal isn't just to get a degree - I want to use this time to build a strong foundation for my future. I'm working on personal projects and building a home lab so I graduate with more than just textbook knowledge. School is a stepping stone toward real-world impact and hands-on expertise.</p>
